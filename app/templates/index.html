    <p> the game of HIPE was described by Peter Winkler in his excellent collection of mathematical puzzles</p>

    <p>the rules are very straightforward, you are given a string of letters, and your goal is to find an English word that contains those letters as a substring. So, for example, if the string were 'HIPE', the answer might be 'arcHIPElago'.</p>

    <a class = "btn btn-primary" href="{{ url_for('random') }}">Play Hipe</a>
</div>
